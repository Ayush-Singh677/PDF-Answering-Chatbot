# Smart Querying for PDFs

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## Introduction

This application provides a interface for querying a pdf file smartly .It performs detailed text extraction from pdf using tessaract and preprocessing, including text cleaning and segmentation into manageable chunks. These chunks are embedded using the sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2 model and stored in a FAISS vector database for efficient similarity searches. Users can input queries related to the PDF content, with responses generated by the t5-large model, which synthesizes information from relevant text chunks to deliver precise answers.
